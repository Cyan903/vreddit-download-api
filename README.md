# vreddit-download-api

Created mainly for the frontend, but I thought this api would be better in it's own repo. Serves as a way to get direct links to video and audio downloads from `v.redd.it`. I might rewrite this in a different framework or language sometime...

#### To build...
```
$ pnpm run build
